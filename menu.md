| Schweineschnitzel    | A schnitzel is a thin piece of meat pounded into a flat slice. You then bread the meat before frying it. You can eat deep-fried or pan-fried schnitzel. In Germany, they use mainly pork as the meat of choice. Wiener Schnitzel, which is more of an Austrian dish, is probably the most popular here in North America. This is a cutlet layered with ham and cheese and then breaded and pan-fried. A traditional Weiner Schnitzel is made with veal, but you can substitute whatever meat you like. Many Germans like to eat schnitzel with fried potatoes and cream sauces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ![food1](images/Schnitzel.png)                 |             259 |        |
|   Labskaus                   | Labskaus is a beef dish. German sailors in the 18th century developed it, and it became popular amongst many people on land.

|       Reibekuchen                       | Reibekuchen is German potato patties or pancakes. If you have had latkes before, you will find Reibekuchen very similar to them. You can grate potatoes and then combine them with eggs and flour. Once you form the mixture into patties, you can pan-fry them until crispy. Reibekuchen works as a side dish, and you can have them with apple sauce or minced meat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ![food1](images/Reibekuchen.png)               |             259 |
